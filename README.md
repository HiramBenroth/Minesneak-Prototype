# Overview

This is a Prototype Game where I wanted to see if it was possible to make a minesweeper clone but you have to move around a grid to figure it out.

The game is simple you play as Blue, objective is green. There is an enemy that patrols the top and in some cases can trap you. If the enemy turns orange then you are being chased. 

Arrow keys to move. R to reset if needed.

# Development Environment

I used Pygames, and followed some tutorials.

Python, because its super easy to implement prototypes like this.
